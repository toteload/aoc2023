# My attempt at Advent of Code 2023

Maybe I will try to solve all the problems in under a second or something. 
Good chance I am not going to complete this however >:D 
This would mean an average of 20ms per problem. 
I will exclude printing the solution from the timing.
I run the solutions on a desktop with a 12-core Ryzen 9 7900X and 32GB RAM. 

Input files are not provided, because the creator of Advent of Code prefers it that people don't
share them.
