# My attempt at Advent of Code 2023

To run a specific day with use `cargo run --release --bin day<DAY>`, where `DAY` is a zero padded day number.

Maybe I will try to solve all the problems in under a second or something. 
Good chance I am not going to complete this however >:D 
This would mean an average of 20ms per problem. 
I will exclude printing the solution from the timing.
I run the solutions on a desktop with a 12-core Ryzen 9 7900X and 32GB RAM. 

| Problem       | Duration |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Day 1, part 1 | 40 μs    |
| Day 1, part 2 | 110 μs   |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Total         | 150 μs   |
