# My attempt at Advent of Code 2023

To run a specific day with a specific part use `cargo run --release -- -d <number> -p <number> [-v]`.

The `-d` options specifies the day, and the `-p` option specifies which part of that day to run.
The `-v` option prints the input before running the program.
